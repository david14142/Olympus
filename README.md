# Olympus.js

JavaScript functions to facilitate multivariate summaries of data.

## Introduction

The Olympus libraries allow summarisation of multivariate data
in a browser using only JavaScript. &nbsp;  The aim is to support fast and
 efficient cross tabulation &amp; pivoting of moderate amounts of data
 without relying on either server side or desktop software.  A typical
 use case would be to produce a CSV or JSON file from a database and have
 multiple dynamic tables produced in the browser with minimal (~3 lines) coding.

# Use

*Warning - this project is a prototype.  There may be bugs, and the internal structure and methods of the library **will** change.*

*This documentation is incomplete: merging, sorting,
filtering and indexing still require coverage.*

## JavaScript files

Olympus is intended to be used in a browser.  (It might work in Node.js
  &ndash; but if you have a server, why not use MongoDB or
  CouchDB instead?)

The `Olympus.js` file must be included for basic functionality.
The `Utility.js` contains code to create HTML tables from
summary data, as well as some example reduction functions.  `Merge.js` contains code to join DataFrames.

The project has no external dependencies.

    <script src="Olympus.js"></script>
    <script src="Merge.js"></script>
    <script src="Utility.js"></script>

## Loading data

Olympus can load data read from JSON text files. &nbsp; Alternately,
third party libraries (such as jQuery-CSV) can read CSV files into
arrays and Olympus can convert these.

Typically you would load data with an XHR request.  Then, a table
is created with the data:

    fetch('data.json')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {table = new Oj.DataFrame(json)});

## Mapping

Often data is not quite in the format you'd like it, and has to be cleaned
up and transformed.  Olympus allows 1:1 operation on rows of data by using
the `map()` method.  this method takes a callback function (the
  'mapper') and applies it to each row of data.  For example, this
  simple mapper takes a numeric age variable and groups it
into ten year bins.

    let mapper = function(row) {
      const group =  ['0-9','10-19','20-29','30-39','40-49','50-59','60-69','70-79','80-89','90+'];
      return {'Age Group': group[Math.floor(row['Age']/10)]}
    }

    new_table = table.map(mapper);

`PivotTable.map()` is similar to the native JavaScript `Array.map()`
function, but instead of operating with a single element the function is
applied to a whole row of data at a time.  For example the mapper
above expects a row containing an age variable (hence the
  `row['Age']` reference). The mapper is passed an object,
containing a single row of data, and is expected to return a similar object
containing a row of data.  The result of `PivotTable.map()` is a new
PivotTable containing the result of the mapper applied to every row.

## Aggregating

### Reduce

The second half of the map-reduce paradigm is to take mapped data and
reduce it to a smaller set of variables.  Olympus has a generic
reduce function that will reduce a table to a set of values.&nbsp; Like `Array.reduce()` it returns a single value by applying an
accumulator function.  `PivotTable.reduce()` can apply multiple
functions and return multiple values.  For example to calculate an average
we can sum a variable and divide by a count:

    let result = table.reduce({
        sum: (sum, row) => (sum || 0) + row['Age'],
        n: n => (n || 0) + 1
      });
    let average = result.sum / result.n;

### Aggregate

Reduce can only return a single set of values.  Cross tabulation requires
that we perform aggregation by groups of values &ndash; groups defined by
sets of other variables.  Olympus supports such aggregation using
the `aggregate()` method.  The aggregate method accepts an array
of variables that define the groups, as well as the reduction function(s).

    summary = table.aggregate(['Age Group','Sex'], {
        sum: (sum, row) => (sum || 0) + row['Age'],
        n: n => (n || 0) + 1
      });

The result is a new table that contains the results of the
reduction function for each group.  By default the group variables are
not added to the table as columns &ndash instead they form an
index structure that can be used to traverse the data. If needed,
the groups can be added as columns using the `surface()` method.

### Cross-tabulation

Cross-tabulation (or Pivoting) is the raison d'Ãªtre of Olympus.  

Cross-tabulation involves forming a crossing of two or more *dimensions*,
with each dimension being defined by one or more categorical
variables.  Olympus handles the necessary summarisation and ordering
of the data and the creation of an HTML table within the document with
a few lines of code.

A typical cross-tabulation might look something like this:

    pivot = new Oj.PivotTable(json, {'Sales': Oj.sum('Sales')});
    pivot.dimension(['State','City'],['Year']);
    pivot.table({id: 'anchor'});

This will create a PivotTable object summarise it using the supplied
expression (i.e. a sum of the sales column) into groups defined by State,
City, and Year; and then create an HTML table inside the element with the
'anchor' id.

# Internals

*To be completed*

Olympus works with data stored internally as a *collection of named
arrays*. &nbsp; Each array is a column of data.  These are
native JavaScript arrays - values in the arrays can be strings or
numbers. &nbsp; (Objects, Arrays and Maps are not supported and will
  likely cause unpredictable effects).
